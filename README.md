# yada-datomic

An implementation of the Todo Backend using Clojure, the yada web library, and
Datomic.

## Features

- [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/)
- [Bidirectional URI routing](https://github.com/juxt/bidi)
- [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)
- [yada](https://github.com/juxt/yada)

Have a look in `project.clj` for a more complete list of the dependencies.

## Usage

After cloning the repo, you can run the project from the REPL or doing a
`cider-jack-in` in Emacs.

```
cd yada-datomic
lein repl
```

Once the REPL starts, which may take a few minutes if you're running the project
for the first time, type the following commands:

```
user> (dev)
dev> (go)
```

The server will start and listen on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

For development, you can also seed the database with some initial dummy data by
running:

```
dev> (seed)
```
